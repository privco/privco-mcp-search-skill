  Use the PrivCo MCP tools (`mcp__privco-data-mcp__*`) correctly for company /
  people / funding queries. Covers the non-obvious filter semantics (full state
  name, industry vs keyword, sorting enum, summary-row gaps, includeMissing),
  the standard match → profile → vc_deals workflow, and the two-stage workaround
  for "top N by valuation". Activate when the user wants to search/filter
  PrivCo data, look up a specific company, or build a multi-entity dataset.
  Trigger phrases: "find companies that…", "search PrivCo for…", "who are the
  X companies in Y", "look up <company> in PrivCo", "valuations for…", "build
  a fixture / dataset of companies matching…".

# PrivCo MCP Search

Setup / install: see `INSTALL.md` in this skill folder.
Full per-tool field reference: see `references/usage_guide.md` in this skill folder.

The bullets below are the high-value-per-line distillation — load them once,
do not re-derive by trial and error.

## Tool inventory (17 tools declared in v1.3.3, 15 currently usable)

All tools are exposed under the `mcp__privco-data-mcp__*` namespace once the
MCP server is registered (see `INSTALL.md`).

> ⚠️ **`funding_search` and `deal_search` are documented for forward
> compatibility but may return HTTP 404 against the PrivCo API as of skill
> v1.3.3** — the corresponding backend endpoints are rolling out. Treat
> these tools as documented-but-unavailable; until they're live,
> approximate via `company_search` + per-candidate `vc_deals` / `ma_deals`.
> Calls also require the API key to carry the `funding_search` /
> `deal_search` permission once endpoints are live.

**Stage 1 — entity resolution (name/details → profile_id)**

These two tools look similar but differ in **strictness**, **inputs accepted**,
and **whether they tell you how confident the match is**. Pick deliberately.

- `match` — **strict, exact-ish matching** on company name and/or website
  only. Returns up to 20 ranked candidates as a flat list with no confidence
  score. Designed for: *"the user gave me a recognizable company name, give me
  the canonical row(s)."* Because the criteria are intentionally strict, it
  can **silently miss results when the input is incomplete or differs even
  slightly from the source data** (e.g., "Stripe" vs "Stripe, Inc.",
  "stripe.io" vs "stripe.com"). First row is usually correct for unique
  brands; common-word names need disambiguation by `profile_type`,
  `profile_classification`, `industry`. Pass `includeCityState: true` to
  surface HQ city/state in the result rows for co-located collisions.
  Inputs: `name`, `website`, `includeCityState`. GET endpoint, response shape:
  `{data: [{name, profile_id, profile_type, profile_classification, permalink, location, industry, website[]}], meta}`.

- `identification` — **flexible, fuzzy / tolerant** matching that accepts
  many partial inputs (DBA, URL, address, country/state/city/zip, phone,
  industry, Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter URLs, alternate names, reference IDs)
  and returns ranked candidates **with a confidence score**. Designed for:
  *"I have messy, partial, or fuzzy fields from an external source — give
  me the best mapping with a probability so I can decide whether to trust
  it."* POST endpoint to `/identification/company`. Each result row carries:
  - `mapping_strength` — integer 1–5 (higher = stronger). `mapping_strength_need_review: "Yes"` flags rows that should be human-reviewed before being trusted.
  - `matching_probability` — float 0–1 (raw confidence).
  - `match_summary` / `mismatch_summary` — human-readable strings explaining
    *why* the engine scored it that way (e.g. `"Exact Name Match"` /
    `"Reference ID Mismatch|Phone Mismatch"`).
  - Optional `threshold` query param (default 0.75) filters out
    low-confidence candidates server-side.
  Inputs (all optional except `name`): `name`, `dba`, `url`, `country`,
  `state`, `city`, `address`, `zip`, `phone`, `industry`, `social_facebook`,
  `social_linkedin`, `social_twitter`, `linkedin_url`, `classification`,
  `clean_name`, `fn` (formal/legal name), `aka`, `reference_id`,
  `company_only`.

**Decision rule**: clean recognizable name/URL → start with `match`. Messy
external data (CRM dump, prospect list, partner feed) or you need a
confidence number to gate downstream automation → use `identification`.
If `match` returns 0 or visibly-wrong rows for what should be a known
entity, retry with `identification` — it's the more forgiving path.

**Stage 2 — discovery (criteria → candidate list)**
- `company_search` — multi-filter (location, industry, keyword, revenue,
  valuation, funding, employees, growth, year founded, PE/VC inclusion). Up to
  50 summary rows per page.
- `people_search` — equivalent for contacts.
- `funding_search` ⚠️ **api-nest source landed 2026-05-13, awaiting staging
  deploy — still returns 404.** Round-centric search (fundingTypes, total,
  timestamp, industry, location, investor types, keyword). Use once
  deployed when the question is *about rounds* rather than *about
  companies*. Same gotchas as `company_search`: `keyword.condition` is
  required (`"should"` / `"must"`). Until deploy, approximate via
  `company_search` (with funding filters) + per-candidate `vc_deals`.
- `deal_search` ⚠️ **api-nest source landed 2026-05-13, awaiting staging
  deploy — still returns 404.** M&A-deal-centric search (target/buyer/seller
  industries, deal value, query, isPeDeal, target PE/VC-backed flags).
  **Filter precedence quirk**: setting `isPeDeal` (any boolean) SUPPRESSES
  `inclusionExclusion.targetsIsPeBacked`/`targetsIsVcBacked`/`buyersAllOfType`
  — don't mix. Default sort: relevance if `query` set, else `timestamp desc`.
  Until deploy, approximate via `company_search` + per-candidate `ma_deals`.
- `industry_keyword` — autocomplete for keyword IDs (use before `keyword`
  filter when unsure).
- `industry_pics` — list of PICS top-level industry codes.

**Stage 3 — enrichment (profile_id → full record)**
- `profile` — full **company** profile (revenue, employees, funding, founders,
  contacts, investors, competitors, subsidiaries).
- `general_profile` — full profile for **non-company** entities (Investor,
  Person, etc.). Use when `profile_type != "Company"` from `match`.
- `people` — execs & board on a company.
- `financials` / `revenue_financials` — multi-year statements / revenue-only
  time series.
- `vc_deals` — round-by-round funding (per-round valuation, amount, date,
  investors). Use this for `latestValuation` since `profile` doesn't carry it.
- `ma_deals` — M&A history.

**Stage 4 — contact reveal (hash → details)**
- `company_contact` — resolve a contact hash to full businessEmail / phone /
  LinkedIn.
- `investor_contact` — same for investor-associated contacts.
- Both take the **opaque hash** from `people_search` row's `hash` field.
  **NOT** from `profile.contacts[]` — that block has no hash, just
  `{title, name, email}` summary.
- `associatedType` on the people_search row tells you which reveal endpoint
  to use: `Company` → `company_contact`, `Investor` → `investor_contact`.
- To find Investor-associated rows, you **must** pass
  `{"filters": {"investorOnly": true}}` to people_search — default is
  Company-only and title filters like `["Partner"]` are not effective.
- A successful call **consumes a contact-reveal credit** on the account —
  don't call speculatively.

## Filter semantics — the gotchas

### 1. `location.state` requires the full state name

```jsonc
// WRONG — silently returns 0 hits
{"location": {"selection": [{"type": "state", "value": "NY"}]}}
// RIGHT
{"location": {"selection": [{"type": "state", "value": "New York"}]}}
```

The response payload returns `"hq_state": "NY"`, so the response shape does not
telegraph the required input shape. Verified empirically: `"NY"` → 0 hits,
`"New York"` → 6,444 hits on the same query.

### 2. `industry` vs `keyword` are distinct filters

| Filter | Vocabulary | Example values | When |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------|
| `industry.rawIndustries` (or `.selection`) | PICS top-level | `"Software & Internet Services"`, `"Biotechnology"` | Broad industry buckets |
| `keyword.rawKeywords` (or `.selection`) | Tagged terms from `industry_keyword` autocomplete | `"Fintech"`, `"Payments"`, `"Generative AI"` | Specific business-model / tech tags |

Passing a broad word like `"Software"` to `keyword.rawKeywords` returns **0
hits** — it isn't a registered keyword. Call `industry_keyword(query: "...")`
first when unsure.

### 3. `inclusionExclusion` is a requirement, not an addition

```jsonc
{"inclusionExclusion": {"pe": "include"}}   // REQUIRE PE-backed
{"inclusionExclusion": {"pe": "exclude"}}   // EXCLUDE PE-backed
```

`"include"` means *must be* PE-backed, not *also include*. Combining with other
restrictive filters quickly empties the result set — drop one filter at a time
when debugging zero-result queries.

### 4. `sorting.field` enum is small

Valid: `name | state | employee | industry | yearFounded | totalFunding |
revenueGrowthRate1 | revenueGrowthRate3 | hasContact`.

**Not sortable**: `latestValuation`, `latestRevenue`, `latestEbitda`. For "top
N by valuation" workflows, see Workflow C below.

### 5. `revenue.includeMissing` quietly changes result composition

`includeMissing: true` includes companies with null/empty revenue — common for
early-stage AI companies (Reflection AI, Thinking Machines Lab, xAI all have
`latestRevenue: null`). When testing "revenue > X" assertions, leave it
**false** (default).

### 6. `keyword.condition` is required whenever `keyword` filter is used

```jsonc
// WRONG — 400 Bad Request
{"keyword": {"rawKeywords": ["Fintech"]}}
// RIGHT
{"keyword": {"rawKeywords": ["Fintech"], "condition": "should"}}
```

`condition` is `"should"` (match any keyword) or `"must"` (match all). It's
match-engine terminology — don't confuse with `inclusionExclusion`'s
`include` / `exclude` (different filter, different vocabulary).

### 7. `profileType` path param is lowercase

```jsonc
// WRONG — 400 with cryptic "profileType must be one of the following values: "
GET /profile/Company/44612
// RIGHT
GET /profile/company/44612
```

`'company' | 'investor' | 'advisor'`. Affects `profile`, `general_profile`,
`people`, `vc_deals`, `ma_deals`. The MCP handlers don't normalize casing.

### 8. `deal_search.isPeDeal` SUPPRESSES sibling filters (when deployed)

Setting `filters.isPeDeal` to any boolean **silently disables**
`inclusionExclusion.targetsIsPeBacked`, `inclusionExclusion.targetsIsVcBacked`,
and `buyersAllOfType` in the same request. The precedence rule is documented
in `api-nest/src/search/deal-search/docs.md` and intentionally ported from
the legacy PHP. Pick one approach per query:

- Want *only* PE deals? → `{"isPeDeal": true}` (alone).
- Want deals where the *target* is PE-backed? → omit `isPeDeal`, use
  `{"inclusionExclusion": {"targetsIsPeBacked": "include"}}`.

### 9. `deal_search` sort default depends on whether `query` is set

When `sorting` is omitted: response is ordered by **relevance scoring** if
`filters.query` is set, otherwise by `timestamp desc`. Explicit `sorting`
always wins. Pass `{"sorting": {"field": "timestamp", "order": "desc"}}`
when you want deterministic ordering regardless of query presence.

## Summary rows: included vs omitted

`company_search` summary rows contain:
- ✅ `id`, `name`, `state`, `industry`, `url` (permalink), `keywords[]`,
  `classification` (Private/Public), `revenueGrowthRate1`,
  `revenueGrowthRate3`, `latestEbitda`
- ❌ `latestRevenue`, `latestValuation`, `totalFunding`, `yearFounded`,
  `ownersFounders`, `headquarters.city`, `summary`, funding-round detail, M&A
  detail

If you need any omitted field, follow up with `profile` per company.
Round-level data → also `vc_deals`. M&A detail → also `ma_deals`. **Budget the
round-trips when planning multi-candidate work** — a 22-company dataset is
~22+ profile calls plus targeted vc_deals/ma_deals.

## Practical workflows

### A. Named-entity lookup

```
match(name="Airbnb")            → profile_id 78
profile(78)                     → full record
vc_deals(profileType="company", profileId=78)   → all rounds + valuations
ma_deals(profileType="company", profileId=78)   → M&A history
```

3–4 calls per entity for full enrichment.

### B. Filter-criteria discovery

```
1. industry_keyword(query="fintech")    → keyword id (if using id-based filter)
2. company_search({
       location: {selection: [{type: "state", value: "New York"}]},
       industry: {rawIndustries: ["Software & Internet Services"]},
       revenue: {min: 1000000},
       inclusionExclusion: {pe: "include"}
   }, sorting: {field: "totalFunding", order: "desc"})
3. For each candidate of interest → profile(id) for dollar fields
```

### C. "Top N by valuation" workaround (two-stage)

```
1. company_search(filters: {latestValuation: {min: 1000000000}},
                  sorting: {field: "totalFunding", order: "desc"})
2. Take top ~50 (totalFunding correlates roughly with valuation tier)
3. profile() each → real latestValuation
4. Sort client-side by latestValuation desc, take top N
```

The API can filter by valuation but not sort by it.

### D. Recent funding ("raised >X in year Y")

```
1. company_search(filters: {latestFundingYear: {min: 2023},
                            funding: {min: 10000000}})
2. For round-level confirmation, vc_deals() each → inspect round dates
```

`latestFundingYear` filters on the *most recent* round; `funding.min` on the
**cumulative total**. If the user means "raised >$10M in 2023 specifically",
confirm with `vc_deals` round dates.

## Field-shape gotchas

- Dollar fields are VARCHAR strings on `profile` (`"19400000000"`) — parse
  client-side.
- `profile.investors[]` is aggregated across rounds with duplicates — dedupe
  before display.
- `vc_deals` dates use split-VARCHAR pattern: `{"year": "2017", "month": "3",
  "day": "9"}`. `day` may be `""`. Compare as strings.
- `vc_deals` rows where target is a *different* company are returned when the
  queried company acted as an investor — filter by `target_company_id ==
  queried_id` for self-funding only.
- `profile.summary` is often empty for non-flagship entities — don't promise
  it in assertions.
- There is no `latestValuation` field on `profile`. Get it from
  `vc_deals` (last round's `valuation`).
- Public companies have null/no private-valuation field; their market cap
  isn't in PrivCo.

## When building a fixture / assertion dataset

- Every "filter must exclude X" assertion needs a representative X **inside
  the dataset**, otherwise the test passes vacuously. Pair each positive slot
  with at least one negative control on the same axis (CA-software vs
  NY-software, low-rev vs rev>1M, pre-2015 vs post-2015).
- Reuse rich anchor entities across many slots to keep the dataset small.
- Track coverage in an explicit matrix doc so the fixture set can be
  re-validated when the assertion list changes.

## Auth & deployment

- The MCP server reads `PRIVCO_API_KEY` from its environment (set in the MCP
  client config — see `INSTALL.md`).
- It connects to the PrivCo v3 API and sends the key as the `x-api-key`
  header.
- For the full per-tool field reference, common pitfalls in one-line form, and
  expanded workflow detail, see `references/usage_guide.md` in this skill
  folder.

## When this skill applies — and when not

**Apply** when the user is doing entity lookup, criteria-driven discovery,
fixture/dataset building, or any multi-tool MCP workflow against PrivCo data.

**Skip** when the user is editing the `privco-data-mcp` server source itself,
or when they're talking to the PrivCo REST API directly without the MCP
wrapper.
